# Computer-Science-Resources

Contains helpful resources for the following:
- **Data Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Vectors, Stacks, FIFO (Regular) Queues, Priority Queues, Heaps, Binomial Queues/Heaps, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Hash Tables, Time Complexity, and Quicksort/Other Sorting Algorithms.
- **C**: Opaque Object Design in C, Best practices for malloc/calloc/realloc, Performance of malloc/calloc/realloc, and bitwise operators.
- **Linux**: Contains a guide to working in the Linux command line, working with the Vim text editor, and a guide to Makefiles. These three things aren't exclusive to Linux meaning the command line can be used in Mac and Windows (some commands are different), Vim can be installed on Mac and Window, and Makefiles can be used on Mac and Windows if make is installed. However, these guides are geared torwards Linux and these things are traditionally used in Linux. Additionally contains a guide to recovering Vim swap files.
- **C++**: Basics of Classes, Operator Overloading, Copy/Move Semantics, Inheritance, Function Overloading/Parameters/Default Arugments, and others (work in progress).
- **Evil Hangman**: An overview of the classic evil hangman project in COMP.1020-Computing II.


**Note**
- It may be preferable to download the document PDFs and view the downloaded PDFs directly instead of viewing them on GitHub. When viewing the documents on GitHub it's possible that some of the content will not display very clearly. For example, the equal sign "=" might look like the subtraction operator "-".
- If viewing the documents directly on GitHub then sometimes the pages can get stuck loading when scrolling down. Sometimes there will be a spinning icon that will get stuck. In that case, click the area right where the spinning icon is to load them. Other times there will be a *load more pages* button that must be clicked and after clicking it the button goes way but the pages don't load. In that case, click that same area where the button was once again in order to load the pages.
