This program demonstrates the basics of the opaque object design using a date object as an example.
- Create an initializer function - default date initializer, could also create custom initializers to initialize with a specific date.
- Create setter functions with error checking - set the day/month/year to a new value.
- Create getter functions - see what the current day/month/year is
- Create other useful functions for the object - print out the date.
- Create a destroyer function to free up the memory for the object to avoid memory leaks.
