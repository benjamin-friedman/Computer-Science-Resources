# Inheritance Bassics

Files
- **InheritanceBasicsPart1.cpp**: How to properly implement constructors (including the copy constructor), the copy assignment operator, and destructors in inheritance. Additionally, through a series of print statements the main program shows the order in which the constructors
  and destructors get called.
- This section is incomplete - additional parts will be added later.
